# queens.py
#
# ICS 33 Fall 2023
# Project 0: History of Modern
#
# A module containing tools that could assist in solving variants of the
# well-known "n-queens" problem.  Note that we're only implementing one part
# of the problem: immutably managing the "state" of the board (i.e., which
# queens are arranged in which cells).  The rest of the problem -- determining
# a valid solution for it -- is not our focus here.
#
# Your goal is to complete the QueensState class described below, though
# you'll need to build it incrementally, as well as test it incrementally by
# writing unit tests in test_queens.py.  Make sure you've read the project
# write-up before you proceed, as it will explain the requirements around
# following (and documenting) an incremental process of solving this problem.
#
# DO NOT MODIFY THE Position NAMEDTUPLE OR THE PROVIDED EXCEPTION CLASSES.
